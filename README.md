Design of CUDA-based [Label Propagation Algorithm (LPA)], aka RAK, for [community detection].

Community detection is the problem of identifying natural divisions in networks. Efficient parallel algorithms for identifying such divisions are critical in a number of applications. This report presents an optimized implementation of the Label Propagation Algorithm (LPA) for community detection, featuring an asynchronous LPA with a Pick-Less (PL) method every `4` iterations to handle community swaps, ideal for SIMT hardware like GPUs. It also introduces a novel per-vertex hashtable with hybrid quadratic-double probing for collision resolution. On an NVIDIA A100 GPU, our implementation, ŒΩ-LPA, outperforms FLPA, NetworKit LPA, and GVE-LPA by `364x`, `62x`, and `2.6x`, respectively, on a server with dual 16-core Intel Xeon Gold 6226R processors - processing `3.0B` edges/s on a `2.2B` edge graph - and achieves `4.7%` higher modularity than FLPA, but `6.1%` and `2.2%` lower than NetworKit LPA and GVE-LPA.

Below we plot the time taken by [FLPA], [NetworKit] LPA, [GVE-LPA], and ŒΩ-LPA on 13 different graphs. ŒΩ-LPA surpasses FLPA, NetworKit LPA, and GVE-LPA by `364`, `62√ó`, and `2.6√ó` respectively, achieving a processing rate of `3.0B` edges/s on a `2.2ùêµ` edge graph.

Below we plot the speedup of ŒΩ-LPA wrt FLPA, NetworKit LPA, and GVE-LPA.

Next, we plot the modularity of communities identified by FLPA, NetworKit LPA, GVE-LPA, and ŒΩ-LPA. ŒΩ-LPA on average obtains `4.7%`higher modularity than FLPA, but `6.1%` / `2.2%` lower modularity than NetworKit LPA / GVE-LPA. We recommend employing ùúà-LPA on web graphs and social networks. For road networks, however, GVE-LPA appears to be the most effective, while NetworKit LPA is recommended for protein k-mer graphs.
